*My custom printf implementation project*

## What is this?
**ft_printf** is my own version of the printf function that I wrote myself. It's a school project that helps me learn how to handle different data types and format output in C. I'll use this function in other projects later.

## Format Codes I Built

### Character & String Formats
- **Characters**: `%c` (single letter)
- **Text**: `%s` (words/sentences)
- **Symbols**: `%%` (percent sign)

### Number Formats
- **Whole Numbers**: `%d`, `%i` (regular numbers)
- **Positive Only**: `%u` (unsigned numbers)
- **Hex Numbers**: `%x`, `%X` (base 16)

### Pointer Format
- `%p`: Print memory addresses

## How to use it

### What you need
To use this function, you need:
- A C compiler (like `gcc`) to turn code into programs.
- A computer with Linux or macOS.

### How to set it up
1. Download the code:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:mouadisfree/ft_printf.git
   cd ft_printf


2. Build the library:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This makes a file called `libftprintf.a` that contains my printf function.

## Who made this
Made by **mouadisfree** as a student at **1337 School** (part of the 42 coding schools).

## Thanks
Thanks to 1337 School and all my peers who helped me learn!
